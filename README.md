# DocumentSimilarity
M2 - Data Science Algorithm - Document Similarity

The objective of this programming assignment is to be able to implement a system for document similarity, using the Min-Hash and Locality Sensitive Hashing methods presented during the lectures.

Implement the full workflow for document similarity,
1. transform the documents into sets of k-shingles
2. create the signature matrix, using n min-hash function
3. use Locality Sensitive Hashing, by carefully choosing the threshold to minimize the number of candidate document pairs
4. compute the true Jaccard similarity for the document pairs, and output them if above the threshold
